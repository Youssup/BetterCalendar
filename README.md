# BetterCalendar

### This is Better Calendar! A program that connects to your Google Calendar, designed to make your scheduling experience as easy as possible. It automatically sets reminders for upcoming events, so you never have to worry about when you shoud leave for your next appointment. 

## Why?
 As a commuter in college, I always worried about being late to class. I constantly calculated in my head how much time it would take me to get to school and when I should leave so I could make it in time. It stressed me out in the morning and I couldn't account for traffic. 

I created this project so me and many others could relax with ease of mind, and be late to class anyways.
